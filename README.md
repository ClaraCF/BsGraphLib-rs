This is a small and simple library for drawing computer graphics using ASCII on your terminal.  
This is a rewrite of [this](https://github.com/Chocobonis/Bs-Graph-lib) project (originally written in C/C++) by [@Chocobonis](https://github.com/Chocobonis) written in Rust.

    This project is still under active development, and may be unstable or unsuitable for use in production. It is still full of bugs, badly implemented hacks, etc. I'm currently working on optimizations, fixes and re-implementations, but in the meantime,<br>use at your own risk!
